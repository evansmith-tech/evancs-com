I am Evan Smith. I work google cloud's GCE (google compute engine), on Local SSD storage. Before that I worked on Google Distributed Cloud, on network attached block and file storage. 

I like storage. 


Here I (sometimes) post and (mostly) repost stuff about programming, storage, etc.

The goal for this site is more or less to be a place to provide a centralized reading list on various storage topics. In doing so, I learn more about storage, and write it down somwhere. I think there is an absolute gap in the knowledge market regarding storage (in regards to programming). I was kinda told, "Learn it on the job". I feel this website will be a great reference for me, and maybe others. 

I also post things that I just think are valuable here, as well as my own projects.
